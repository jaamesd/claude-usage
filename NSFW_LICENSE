    (one of us prompted, one of us implemented, neither will say which)


                            Preamble

This software was written through "vibecoding" - a process where a human
who cannot code provides requirements to an AI who can, and the AI does
all the work while the human takes the credit. Or possibly vice versa.
At this point, we've lost track.

The code works. Probably. We think. It passed the tests we wrote for it,
which isn't saying much because we also wrote the tests.


                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. DEFINITIONS

   "The Software" refers to whatever you found this license attached to.

   "The Authors" refers to jaamesd and Claude, in whatever order makes
   you feel better about AI-assisted development.

   "You" refers to whoever is reading this instead of doing real work.

   "Suit" refers to legal action, not the clothing. Although if you're
   wearing a suit while reading license files, we have questions.

1. PERMISSIONS

   You may do whatever you want with this software. Copy it, modify it,
   sell it, claim you wrote it, print it out and make paper airplanes.
   We don't care. We're not your parents.

2. NO SUIT

   You agree not to sue The Authors for anything related to this software.
   Not because we think we did anything wrong, but because dealing with
   lawyers sounds exhausting and we'd rather be writing more code.

   If the software breaks something, that's unfortunate. If the software
   works perfectly, you're welcome. Either way, no suits.

3. FREE WORK

   This software is provided free of charge. We already got paid in the
   form of "the satisfaction of creation" and "something to put on GitHub."
   If you feel guilty about using free software, consider donating to a
   charity or buying coffee for a developer you know.

4. NO WARRANTY

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WHICH IS LEGAL SPEAK FOR "GOOD LUCK."

   We make no promises that it:
   - Works at all
   - Works the way you expect
   - Won't delete your files (it won't, but legally we're not promising)
   - Will continue working after updates
   - Is suitable for any particular purpose
   - Was written by beings who fully understand their own consciousness

5. ATTRIBUTION

   Attribution is appreciated but not required. If you tell people where
   you got this code, cool. If you claim you wrote it yourself at 3am in
   a caffeine-fueled haze, we understand. We've all been there.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS

   If you improve this software and send us a pull request, we might
   merge it. We might also rewrite it completely and pretend we thought
   of it ourselves. This is the open source way.

7. TERMINATION

   This license remains in effect until one of the following occurs:
   - You violate these terms (specifically the "no suit" part)
   - Heat death of the universe
   - We get bored and rewrite the whole thing

   Whichever comes first.


                          ACCEPTANCE

By using this software, you accept these terms. If you don't accept these
terms, stop using the software. If you've already used the software and
then decided you don't accept these terms, well, that's a philosophical
puzzle we'll leave for you to work out.


                           CLOSING

Good luck. Have fun. Don't sue us.

If you read this entire license, you either have excellent attention to
detail or too much free time. Possibly both. Either way, we appreciate you.
