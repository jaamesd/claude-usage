                         Preamble

This software is probably safe for wearing. We looked through the source
code and didn't find anything concerning. If you want to print it on a
shirt, we're not going to stop you.

It's probably safe. We haven't seen evidence otherwise. That's not the
same as a guarantee, but it's something.
